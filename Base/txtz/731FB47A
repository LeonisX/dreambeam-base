Championship Surfer is a surf rider's dream with 10 outrageous beaches, 5-to-30-foot breakers, and 8 world class surfers including Cory Lopez, Shane Beschen, and Rochelle Ballard. All you have to do is rip barrels, 360's, and aerials, slashes, Rio's (more than 40 tricks in all) against the best surfers in the world -- and you can grab the Ultimate Championship.
 
Championship Surfer uses a true 3D wave generation engine to produce 
realistic waves that swell, curl and break just like the real thing and all beautifully rendered in real-time on your Dreamcast.
