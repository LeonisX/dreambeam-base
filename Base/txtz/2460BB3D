BURN RUBBER WITH THE PROS. 
Now is your chance to re-live moments of Grand Prix glory and change history! F1 World Grand Prix takes you to actual rounds of the '98 Grand Prix races -- complete with the weather of the day -- and allows you a shot at the championship. The cockpit is 3D with 2 virtual views, and to make your experience even more realistic, the racecars sustain damage when they crash into a wall or opponent. Your tires may lose traction and start to unravel, so get to the pit quick for repairs and refueling or you'll be left in the dust. Keep an eye out for the five different flags that will alert you to track activities. Each race rocket you select comes with a preview of championship history and overall position, as well as the drivers and their 
stats. Artificial Intelligence recreates the champion racer's driving style so you can follow in the tire tread of your heroes!
