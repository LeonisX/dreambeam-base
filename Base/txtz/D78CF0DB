Maken X goes above and beyond the usual slicefest. In this first-person adventure on Sega Dreamcast, you play as Maken X, aka "Soul Sword." This powerful entity can "brain-jack," or take over, the minds and bodies of other characters. Inhabiting a new body not only boosts your strength, but also lets you access its unique powers. The ability to manipulate a person's "psi," or soul, was discovered in a research lab and promptly hidden in the Soul Sword. Terrorists have kidnapped the chief scientist, and his daughter Kay has awakened Maken X to assist her in rescuing her father. As the quest continues, Maken and Kay go up against a slew of disturbing, evil characters in real-time, sword-slinging combat. As Maken, you definitely have the sharper edge in this contest of wills. But you must rely on skill and strategy to finish with all your limbs attached. There are 7 different endings to this slasher, so your every move will decide your ultimate fate.
