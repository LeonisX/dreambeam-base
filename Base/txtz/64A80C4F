Also a note to the people of the so called 'legitimate press':
 
Please take a moment and look at yourselves before you go on your  writing campaigns against piracy. I am 100% absolutely positive that you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene doesn't deny its roots.
