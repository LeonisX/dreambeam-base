One of the best game ever ;) French people will be really happy with this
 release featuring the voice of Jean-Pierre Foucault, the famous presentator
 of "Who wants to be a millionnaire" in France. Questions & help in french

 A great thanks to my favourite supplier & music maker : Ninja. Be sure to
 hear its composition (done in 24h, don't hope an orchestral symphony) as
 the first audio track of this cd. It is usually 4s and only for selfboot
 but Console4Fr bring you another use for it, group audio compo ! :)
 (Let's see if other groups take the point and make one for themselves ;) )

 This release is definetely a must for french people and maybe just a
 collector for others... Anyway it's new and we had to release it !

 Be sure to support the company and buy this great game, it deserves it ;)
