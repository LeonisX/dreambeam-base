The idea for this game is that you must build barriers on arena to stop the water from leaking out. As you go the along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and  earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and  fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practise mode available, and you can play against a friend. If you like Tetris, then this puzzle game is just the thing.
