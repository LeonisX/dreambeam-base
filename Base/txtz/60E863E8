GEAR UP THE HARDWARE, WE'RE UNDER LIVE FIRE!
Fans of shooters are in for the ultimate test of reflex and skill with Capcom's release of its arcade shooter Giga Wing for Sega Dreamcast. The top-down graphics and stereo sound have been ported perfectly from the arcade version, and the bullets are flying non-stop! You'll face down flaming death, with your only protection provided by a cautiously rationed shield function. Each player picks their primary weapon at the outset of the game; power-ups provide strength and functions for this weapon. You'll also be provided with smart bombs, which will destroy all onscreen enemies. At the end of each level, you'll go mano-a-mano with an oversized, over-armored, and overpowered boss. Get in the pilot's seat and let's rage!

- Four Modes of play - Arcade, Score Attack Mode, Gallery and Training.
- Graphically impressive terrain. 
- Revolutionary Reflect Response shield deflects enemy fire, but it must be recharged after each use.
- Choose from many different primary weapons, including homing missiles, side-fire cannons, heavy bombs and lasers. 
- Collect pieces of destroyed enemy ships for bonus points.
- Score Multiplier -- rack up astronomical scores based on player skill.
- Level-end bosses will challenge your ingenuity.
