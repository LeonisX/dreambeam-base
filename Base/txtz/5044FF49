Это то же, что и Omikron - The Nomad Soul (Non-Rus) (Play Zero) 

The game's plot centers around soul-jumping from body to body to escape capture by evil demons. This reincarnation is an 
original concept and gives you the opportunity to become 30 different characters. You begin by jumping into the body of 
Kay'l, who pleads with you for help. As Kay'l, you are plunged into the immense, futuristic world 
that is Omikron.

The 3D graphical world you explore is large and impressive. Futuristic in design, the graphics are somewhat boxy,  as is true for many action games, but they are still nicely done. Each location is individual in its appearance, different yet consistent with the overall atmosphere.

For all of you who actually understand enough French to play the game without subtitles, I would like to warn you that I had to modify some audio in content to make the bitch fit on on a 700MEG/80Mins CDR.

There is also a seperate .rar file that includes the stripped Video and fabulous song from David Bowie composed for that game!
