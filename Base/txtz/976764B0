Take back the Theed Royal Palace in fast and furious lightsaber assaults. You will have the power of the Force and your trusty Jedi saber as you ward off legions of battle droids, destroyer droids, assassins and other creatures from the Star Wars: Episode I worlds. Choose to fight as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, or Jedi Council members Mace Windu, Plo Koon or Adi Gallia as you work your way through each level. But be wary - you never know which droid army or massive beast lurks around the next corner. 
* Single or Dual Player: A skilled member of the Jedi Council can fight at your side in two-player sessions.
* Gain power boosts, new moves and enhanced Jedi abilities as you move further within the various worlds.
* Face threats that get more and more challenging as you progress through 10 incredible levels.
