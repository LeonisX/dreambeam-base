Rip notes .: nothing ripped

TO STAY ON TOP, YOU'LL HAVE TO DIG DOWN DEEP!

Mr Driller's world has been covered with mysterious colored blocks.
Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out !
Blocks will bond together and, depending on the path you burrow, will prevent other blocks from falling on your head. Find the
air bubbles to keep you alive while you drill for a higher score, but be careful going after them - you could end up squashed by the blocks above.
Drill, drill, drill ! One you start drillin', there's no chillin' !

- Fast-paced, frantic puzzle action with 3 addictive modes
