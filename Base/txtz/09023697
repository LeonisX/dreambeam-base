Rip Notes:
All movies were downsampled on this rip. Half of the music files were also changed from Stereo to Mono. The bloated browser was ripped and so was Japanese speech. Obviously, do not set the speech to Japanese in the Options. As just about everyone knows by now, the 2 previous Hooligans rips are non-working. The 1st one freezes after you complete Level 1 on the Dark Mission, and the 2nd one freezes after you complete Levels 5 and 12 in the Hero Mission. We have tested our rip past both freeze spots and it works. This game is the USA retail copy bought at a store today. We have no idea where the Hooligans copy came from or what it is. We were also not willing to mess with their copy or attempt to fix it because it has corrupt movie files. It is not possible to do a fix for the Hooligans release of the game. So, here is a rip of this major title with the Echelon Seal Of Quality that you can TRUST. Enjoy the game!
