Please take a moment and look at yourselves before you go on your writing campaigns against piracy. I am 100% absolutely positive that you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene doesn't deny its roots.

UNSCRAMBLE THE MYSTERY!
In this sci-fi thriller, a team of archeologists is picking through the ruins of the ancient city of Fogna when they discover the Sleeping Man. He is encased in the cockpit of an egg-shaped machine that comes to be known as Elemental Gimmick Gear (EGG). The machines are duplicated and mass-produced for military and civilian use, but something goes terribly wrong! A sudden disaster destroys the city and awakens the Sleeping Man. He leaves the laboratory where he's slept for 100 years and ventures out into Fogna to try to piece together what happened. Travel across colorful terrain, made even more bright and beautiful by Sega Dreamcast. The hand-drawn lands are detailed and full of Sprites waiting to attack. Your biggest challenge will come in the dungeons, where you will come up against gigantic bosses. Attack with a punch or spin or simply teleport right out of there! The enemies get stronger as you defeat bosses. Maybe you can solve the mystery of this mind-boggling disaster.
