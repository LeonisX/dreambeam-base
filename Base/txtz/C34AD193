SURVIVE THE TERROR OF DINOSAUR ISLAND. 
Strange events have happened on a small island off the coast of Mexico and set the stage for Blue Stinger, an inspired action-thriller on Sega Dreamcast. The story unfolds in lush, realistic, cinematic style and engulfs you in its dense storyline and non-stop action gameplay. Emergency rescue specialist Eliot Ballade and his sidekicks need your help to unravel the dark secrets behind the island's bioengineering research center and its sinister experiments. Your mission will sharpen your wits with complex scenarios, plot twists, mini-adventures, surprise encounters, and host of detective work to be done. Swim, crawl, drive, jump, and blast your way through over 230 locations on the island, and battle a legion of hideous mutant creatures along the way. You'll be awestruck by this meticulously designed world,
mind-blowing explosions, and spectacular effects. Forget sci-fi celluloid. Put yourself center stage.
