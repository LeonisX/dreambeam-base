Rip notes: Nothing Ripped

t's the year 20XX. A very, very large brownie is heading straight toward the planet Earth or some similar looking planet also populated by humans. It is estimated that the brownie will collide into the planet in approximately six hours, give or take a few minutes. The Super Brownie Eradication Taskforce Elite (SBETE) is on the scene and ready to take on the foreboding dessert. However, budget cuts have only left enough money for a single tank of gas, enough to power just one fighter. Straws are drawn. They drink and pass out, leaving the sober janitor alone to save the planet.

Like most shooters, Gunbird 2 has a story and, like most shooters, no one really cares. Who cares that the characters are going after some legendary Almighty Potion? The point of the game is to blow stuff up while dodging other stuff and barely surviving, like any good shooter. Psikyo does include short cinemas between each level to further the story, but, while some are amusing, they are not why we're here. We're here to shoot and kill, Lieberman be damned!
