Crack Notes:
This is the first game in which you can actually swap the disks on disk swap. We had to remove the games CD checks and replace them with our own CD checks. It also needed these replaced in order to boot either one of the CDs. It's also been made self-boot using a new method, and has the CDDA tracks intact. Thanks to all Echelon members who have spent endless hours on this game over the last few days and beat it all the way through.
