Ahhhh. We love the smell of injection moldingin the morning. Little green army men have been a staple in the toy chests of America for decades. Thanks to Midway, the plasticsoldiers are going to become stars by waging
a miniature war on Dreamcast.

Army Men: Sarge's Heroes is a third-person perspective shooter based on the age-old struggle between two mortal enemies: Green and Tan army men.

You control Sarge, a squad leader in the green army. Other soldiers in your command include Scorch, a disturbed flamethrower man; Hoover, a hesitant minesweeper; Shrap, the main mortar dude; and a slacker surfer who failed
to dodge the draft.

The evil Tan army is led by Plasto, who has found a series of portals which connect the world of plastic army men
with the planet Earth. Our world is packed full of items which Plasto can use to destroy the Green army, so Sarge must battle the Tan soldiers to close the plentiful portals.
