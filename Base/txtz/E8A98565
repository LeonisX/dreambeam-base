This game continues the legend of Sega Sports Arcade titles and is sure to keep the most dedicated tennis fan riveted to the net. A perfect translation of the smash arcade hit, the Dreamcast version serves up the same grand slamming gameplay and rich 3D graphics. Crisp animations and realistic sound effects add to the game's 
immersive power. Spectators, ball boys, chair umps, everyone gets into your game and reacts to the scores. Play on realistic courts with surfaces such as clay or grass, and adjust your game as the ball and players respond differently on each. You can even take on that hot-headed friend of yours and test his sportsmanship to its 
 limits in 2-player mode. Eight of the top-ranked players in the world are  included in the game, choose one, and volley your way to the Championship. 
- From the smash-hit arcade original. 
- Realistic 3D environments and fluid animations. 
- Simple controls make it easy to pick up and play.
- Eight internationally ranked men's tennis players to choose from.
- Play on hard court, clay court, grass court, and carpet -- each surface responds differently.
