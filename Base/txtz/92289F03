Midway and developer Kalisto take the racing genre by storm with 4 Wheel Thunder for Sega Dreamcast. Stunning graphics, an astonishing selection of detailed tracks, an amazing soundtrack, and explosive lighting and special effects combine for an experience you won't soon forget
Throw a myriad of upgradeable cars, indoor and outdoor circuits, and the ability to make a shortcut just about anywhere your eye might wander - it all adds up to an awe-inspiring game. The game's aggressive AI will leave you spluttering with road rage; the computer drivers play for keeps.
Customize your earth-eating machine by spending prize money on upgrades and exterior appearances. Race on sixteen incredibly detailed tracks packed with shortcuts including weather effects on bonus tracks.  

If you’ve ever longed to sit behind the wheel of Bigfoot, then strap yourself into 4 Wheel Thunder and feel the power. Choose from the four different racing modes and perfect your off-road racing skills as you seek the title of dirt-track dominator. If the eight stock vehicles aren’t enough for you, unlock some secret rides and really leave the competition behind. Or you can upgrade your truck and try to keep that beast under control at speeds up to 200 mph! Work your way through the uniquely designed tracks but watch out for the rockslides, black ice and volcanic lava! You can challenge a friend with four different multiplayer split-screen modes: Bomb, Bomb Race, Balloon and Tag Battle. If you’re in the mood for realistic 4x4s, crazy tracks and plenty of high-flying off-road racing, then strap on your helmet and get ready for a wild ride with 4 Wheel Thunder.
