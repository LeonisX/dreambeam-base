Origin...: USA - NTSC
Released.: September 7th, 2001
Ripped.......: Nothing

Ooga Booga has spoken! You better hope it's good news, cause if she is displeased, the island volcano goddess will rain meteor showers down on you. You are the Kahuna of one of four tribes -- Twitchy, Hottie, Fatty, or Hoodoo -- and you're battling to win the affections of the testy island goddess. She rewards those she likes with empowering magic spells, which will give your tribe the upper hand in the Ooga Booga skirmishes. Try knocking out your rivals by firing shrunken heads down upon them, and if that doesn't faze them, attack with a swirling tornado, fireball, or a land mine. If somehow they remain standing after all that, wage an aerial attack by climbing aboard a toucan or jump on a wild boar and charge them! 
 While you run about the colorful island made even more beautiful 
 by the power of Dreamcast, watch out for the Tikis and sharks -- yes, you can take a swim if you happen to meet with a fireball. Through the Smakahuna, Rodeo, and Boar Polo Modes, you and three friends can find out, online or off, who is the baddest Kahuna of all!
