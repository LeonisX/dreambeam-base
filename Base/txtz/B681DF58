Rip notes: Nothing Was Ripped

This game offers you to use 2 main "rooms", one for snooker, the other for pool. You have to beet several players on each before you can be named the master of snooker or pool, starting with Clueless Colin in snooker, and One Eyed Jack in pool. Also, in both rooms you have extra features such as a one armed bandit in the pool room and a darts board in the snooker room. And to make it even more special, it is also fully endorsed by Jimmy White himself.
