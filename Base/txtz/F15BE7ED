Note: This is the American version of V-Rally 2 released by Accession a long time ago, but Accession's version had music raped, this one has it intact. Game is a real quality racer, so we felt like re-releasing it. Run UNPACK/INJECT.EXE's then load up the CDI with DiscJuggler as usual and burn. Enjoy this quality title with music.
