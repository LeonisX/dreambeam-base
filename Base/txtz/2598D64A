Rip notes: Down Sampled FMV

After being raised by a pack of lemurs, Aladar is a happy iguanodon, but then disaster strikes and the team need to escape their home island after a huge meteor hits earth. So Aladar, Zini (lemur) & Fila (pterodactyl) must use
their individual skills to help the other dinosaurs to reach the safety of the "nesting grounds". 

Combining elements of arcade/adventure and puzzle solving, team up your characters skills to complete the tasks. Aladar is the strongest, smashing rocks to supply Zini with ammo. Zini is quick & mobile, using rocks to fend off the carnivores. Fila can fly and attack the air based enemies. Its all there for you explore.
