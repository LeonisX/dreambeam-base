From the very beginning, Rayman 2 shows off excellent 3D graphics.
The world of Rayman contains highly detailed atmospheres ranging from a lush tropical forest to a boiling volcano. The inhabitants of this world, from the dancing Teensies to the hilarious Globox, are all shining examples of well constructed characters that bring the game to life.

The sound quality also receives high marks. It's amazing to see just how much great sound can have a positive effect on the gaming experience.  
There aren't exactly any voices though, since all the inhabitants of Rayman's world have their own strange language. Still, every sound effect, from Rayman's own footsteps to Globox's sidesplitting rain dance song, is done to absolute audio perfection.
