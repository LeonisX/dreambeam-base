IT'S TEE TIME.

You don't need to know your birdies from your bogies in Tee-Off, the first golf title to debut on Sega Dreamcast. Wacky, arcade-style action is the name of this game as you play as one of 15 Japanese anime-style golfers, each with different abilities and personalities. 
Before you start, take advantage of the sweeping, panoramic view of each course to form your strategy. With each shot, choose a club based on the ball position and course layout, and determine the force  of your swing. Novice players are given a boost with useful tips and multiple handicap levels. Hit the fairway with up to four of your golf-happy buddies, or go head-to-head against the system for some fast-swinging, putt-sinking fun.
