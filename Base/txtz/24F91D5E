Rip Notes:
This game had a CDDA track full of commentary which was about 74 Minutes long. There is no way to fit the whole commentary track and game data onto 1 CD of 80 Minutes length. So, some of the commentary had to be cut off - Mostly player name announcements on the player select screen and some shot calls. This is the best possible for this title as of now, maybe if we weren't limited to 80 Minutes we could have done a better job - But unfortunately that's just the way things are. Enjoy this rip, and if you like it, BUY IT.
