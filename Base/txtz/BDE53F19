 Bust A Move 4 is the fourth in Taito colorful bubble-based puzzle series. The game is sort of a reverse Tetris, with colored bubbles building up at the top of the screen (and steadily moving further down), with the point being to fire them up from the bottom to place matching colors together, thus making them disappear. The one player game puts you through a series of stages where the aim is to get rid of all the bubbles, while in the two player game, every time you clear a bunch, it  sends some over to your opponent's side, and the goal is simply survival.
