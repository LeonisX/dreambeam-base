Release Notes
The Typing of The Dead is identical in content to House of The Dead 
2, except rather than blast those nasty zombies with your light gun, 
you type them to death using your Dreamcast keyboard! When 
encountering one of the undead a text window appears on screen. Type the phrase associated with that creature, and the evil flesh-eater 
is blasted back to the grave! 

Note: You need a DC Keyboard to use this game at all - Don't bother
with this game if you don't have one.
