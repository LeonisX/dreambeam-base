!Ubisoft has once again its teeth and done a good job on protecting this nice game. We've hardly seen this many creative checks arranged on a single game, as if encryption wasn't already enough. Thanks for a nice time cracking this, too bad it was wasted :) By the way, if you want to use CDIrip or something comparable with this release, don't be surprised if the game doesn't work 100%. Ecko, We really hope you can come through with the USA version of this game. We anxiously await your release of it.
