Rip notes: Edited Audio

Four members of a rock band are guided by the four Elders (KISS) to destroy the Nightmare Child. Only by collecting all the armour scattered through the 40+ levels will you be strong enough to take the demon down. 

Based on the Todd McFarlane comic book guide the band members through the gothic environments taking all the evil monsters out with melee and range weapons, but watch your ammo levels. 

You'll need to take the monster respawn points out quickly in this FPS or you will over whelmed by the amount of creatures after your blood.
