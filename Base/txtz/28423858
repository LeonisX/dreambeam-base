 While presenting "Swingin' Report Show" for Space Channel 5, Ulala watches an attack on the space station by an evil alien race called Morolians. The aliens take over the station by hypnotising everyone on board into .. mindless dancing machines.
 
 Using very simple controls, copy the dance moves and release the humans or zap the aliens, to improve your viewer rating and progress through the game.
 
 The simple gameplay is wrapped up in some of the most unique graphics you will ever see, accompanied with an awesome soundtrack. It seems the 60's has inspired 
 the 25th century as Ulala struts her funky stuff.
