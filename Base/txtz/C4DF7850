Nothing.

In a post 1943 era world, the cause of war and all human strife was found to be the Medallion. The stone has the potential to grant unlimited power to the wielder, and so the forces of light as well as the forces of darkness covet it. Four people all touched by the ceaseless conflict in different ways all come together in one purpose. They will destroy the stone, and thusly take away the world's reason for war. Choose your pilot, ready your aircraft and take to the heavens as you embark on a mission to destroy the war- mongering, Evil Medallion. Prepare yourself for the ultimate test of hand-eye coordination, reflex and skill and rack up 16-digit scores in the dynamic struggle between good and evil.
