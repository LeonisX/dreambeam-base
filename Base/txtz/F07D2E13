Ripped.......: Read Rip Notes

NBA Hoopz is a high-flying, on-fire, NBA licensed, arcade-style basketball game with extreme over-the-top action. The dedicated 3-on-3 format gives you the ability to play as a lightning quick guard, pull up for a baseline jumper as a star forward, or tear down the backboard with a thunderous slam as a rim-rockin' center. Dish the rock, take it to the rack, and bring down the house...this ain't your Daddy's NBA! 

Rip Notes:
Just like our NBA Showtime rip, some of the commentary was cut out of this release. This game had a 80+ Minute CDDA track with commentary only, and this was the only way to proceed. The FMV was also downsampled. Make sure you run UNPACK/INJECT before burning the CDI. Enjoy the best rip of this game possible.
