  **Castlevania : Symphony Of Destruction** DC By VampiricS (VampSoft Studios)

The closest thing to a Castlevania for the Dreamcast!


Informations:

- Now the Music player has all the Castlevania Resurection track in it 
- Optimized some animations 
- Transitions screens between places are now cleaner and animated 
- Now every levels has it's own music tracks (only 4 levels) 
- Better difficulty for the boss (same boss for all levels right now 
- Fixed some things about the Fishman on lvl4 
- No VMU support
- this mod uses BoR version: 1.0028
- Included CDI2Nero for your convenience
Note that the mod didn't really progressed a lot right now because i am working on a real intro movie right now, and it's pretty long to do all alone.

N.B. :I still have a lot of work to do on that mod, like put the real introduction
and the real transition screens.
