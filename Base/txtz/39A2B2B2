Rez is an endorphin machine that releases the essence of trance through futuristic sound and visuals. Players shoot digital enemies to release the enemies frequency. These essence sounds are multiplied upon themselves to create rhythm, and the rhythm then changes the graphics of the game itself. All of this amplifies the players´ groove into creating original music.

By engaging in combat in Rez´s visually arresting environments, players will feel the ecstasy of intertwined color, form, movement and sound, allowing your senses to go for a ride. The more one plays, the more the illusion surrounds and envelopes the senses, as one learns to control the music and the very shape of these worlds.

Set over six levels, each featuring new exclusive tracks by some of the worlds most progressive music artists, you are armed with only a laser, your mission is to track down and wake the central AI Eden by breaking through the firewall of a super virtual network. You are however not invincible in this virtual world´ and must collect items along the way which are downloaded into memory, allowing you to evolve from humanoid form into pure energy.

Rez is the most genre breaking game ever seen, completely submersed in synaesthesia and truly the first playable work of art available on Dreamcast
