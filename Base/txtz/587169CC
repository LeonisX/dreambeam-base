Rip Notes:

 - The CDDA was huge and would not fit without some editing, so
we shortened a few of the tracks. Don't worry - It's barely
noticable. Also, since this game contains CDDA, you must run
UNPACK and INJECT prior to burning the image in DiscJuggler.

- Online play is working as we type this NFO file, but there's
a good possibility that Sega may take down their servers until
the retail date after they see this release.

- The game supports the Broadband Adaptor, Keyboard, & Mouse.

- The game had it's territory protection removed and was tested
on USA, JAP, and PAL consoles.

Nothing more to say, Enjoy the biggest game of March 10 days ahead of the retail date!
