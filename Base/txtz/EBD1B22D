Featuring graphics that surpass almost everything on DC, Soul Calibur is the martial arts fighting game to end all fighting games and the game to get if you're a DC owner. Based on the arcade classic of the same name, it lets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. Each of the game's warriors is armed with a different  deadly weapon -sword, axe, stave, nunchaku, you name it-
and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels. If you own a Dreamcast are thinking of buying one, do yourself a favor and add Soul Calibur to your collection.
