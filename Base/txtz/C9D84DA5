The future is the setting for this Dreamcast racer, MagForce Racing. Controlling vehicles known as Tripods, players must compete in a sport that attempts to defy, or at least bend, the conventional laws of gravity on tracks filled loops, drops, corkscrews, and more. As the need arises, players will need to engage the craft's magnets, lest it lose traction and fall to an untimely end. Using the magnets will deplete their charge, however, forcing players to seek out the yellow orbs strewn about the track in order to recharge them.
The Championship mode provides the bulk of the play experience, with three other modes - Time Trial, Multiplayer classic, and Multiplayer Arcade - fleshing out the choices. Features power-ups offering a standard array of missiles, mines and lasers, and ten tracks in locations from Hawaii and Osaka to Mars and beyond.
