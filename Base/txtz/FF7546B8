Release Notes
This is USA release of Soul Calibur. I know all of you think that CNN has made this release but they did not. The CNN release was never the USA release of Soul Calibur it was a repack and fix of the PAL Utopia release. I am not trying to take anything away from CNN they did a damn good job fixing the PAL Release. There are a few things that are different between the USA and PAL release. For one the save files for this game are not universal like most others so if you went unlocked all the extras playing on the USA GD they will not be unlocked on the PAL release. I have also made sure that this USA release has full support of the VGA BOX.
