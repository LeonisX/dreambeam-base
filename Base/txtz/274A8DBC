For those that are really obsessed with leaving their mark on the street furniture, there's even an option which allows you to design your personal tag and save it to the VMU. Whether you want to scribe an obscenity like, "Shaz woz 'ere" it certainly adds an extra bit of individuality to the proceedings.

At the heart of the game, gameplay is largely enjoyable and addictive in short spells. Tricks are simple to pull off and make it simple to negotiate the relatively complex environments available. What impressed me the most though, was the interactive element of each stage, where you can crash through chairs and tables, while people scurry to get out the way. Almost every ledge, rail and object can be the inspiration for your next trick, especially when you have to reach a particularly intimidating high up spray location. You can even grab onto the back of cars to hitch a free ride or gain a nifty getaway from pursuing crazy cops - time it wrong though and you'll end up embedded into the asphalt! 

Integrated into the gameplay are some of the best looking visuals this side of Crazy Taxi. A mind-blowing polygon count mixed with
razor sharp textures and a lavish palette of colours contribute to making the game a real head-turner. What's more is that the level of pop-up scenery is kept to a minimum and surprisingly is only really a problem on smaller items like benches. There's also a cool crop of DJ cut-ups to soothe your ears during the action.
