Treasure-developed 2D shooter, played from a zoomed-out view. You pilot the Bangaioh, a super-powerful robot, through 40+ stages of free-roaming 2D shooting, with your goal in each level to find and destroy the boss. Along the way, you run into opposition from various enemies, ranging from gun turrets to opponent mechs, and when you're not shooting down these aggressive enemies you can also blast buildings, cars, and basically anything lining the levels. In addition to shooting in all directions, you have available to you two modes of fire, Mami Mode and Ricky Mode. The former fires straight laser blasts that repel off walls, while the latter launches heat seaking missiles. Also released for N64.
