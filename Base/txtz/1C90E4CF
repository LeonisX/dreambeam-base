Ripped by: DCP
Rip notes: Down Sampled FMV & Re-Linked, Edited Audio
Other notes: This is the most complete scene release of VP on the net. Echelon's version had audio tracks ripped out, ours doesnt!!

Another fine racing game graces the Dreamcast in the form of Vanishing Point from ClockWork Games/Acclaim.

Unlike most arcade/realistic racers, you start off with the most basic of cars. Beating the clock will open more cars/tracks and the tune up options, which allows more scope for customisation of your cars. 

Bored with racing, fancy some fun. Then try Stunt Mode, with Crazy Taxi style tasks or grab a buddy and race in the two player mode.

Its no easy ride, but a worthy addition to any DC racing fan's collection.
