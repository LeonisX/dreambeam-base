An evil force has struck Earth, and the harmony created by kindred spirits - dolphins and humans - is in mortal
danger. The force ripped a hole in the space/time continuum, and one dolphin, Ecco, fell through into the past. Our fine finned hero is back in full 3D as the award-winning series continues with Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future on Dreamcast. His mission: to restore the former dolphin/human paradise, save the planet from self-destruction, and win back his future. To do this, you must help Ecco recover the stolen dolphin- power that has been scattered throughout time and space. The bottlenosed dolphin travels through mysterious and breathtaking underwater worlds filled with puzzles, friends, foes, and danger. The graphics in Ecco are just astounding and have floored critics with their unprecedented beauty and sheer detail.


Get reacquainted with Ecco The Dolphin as he makes his first appearance on the Dreamcast. In this epic adventure, you are Ecco, the defender of the sea and all of its creatures. When an alien force simply known as the Foe threatens the balance of your undersea paradise, it’s up to you to stop this menace from disrupting the natural order of things. As a dolphin, you must harness the necessary skills of deep-sea diving, high-flying jumps, and sonar communication to meet your objectives. You can also form alliances with other creatures of the sea that will provide you with necessary clues in this free-form adventure. This game will really put your creative skills to the test, as you won’t have any sidekicks telling you what to do. Experience awesome visuals, an intriguing story, and miles of explorable ocean as you defend your home and try to restore order.
