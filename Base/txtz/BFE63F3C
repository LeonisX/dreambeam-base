Rip Notes: All Pre-Mission Briefing Speech had to be ripped from  this one, it was the only way to make this monster fit down to size. However, all missions do have their briefings written as text also, the speech is just additional to the text briefing. You can still read the text briefing and play this game fine. Also note that the music CDDA was compressed to MP3's, simply run UNPACK.EXE, then run INJECT.EXE after unraring. After that, load up the CDI and burn as usual, Enjoy.
