Shadow the other team's best player with your defensive specialist and protect your star with your enforcer. Fight along the boards to dig out the puck or fight against the other team's enforcer mano a mano. Use Franchise Mode to take a struggling team to the Stanley Cup finals by building up slowly through the draft or choose to win right away through crafty trades and free agent signings.
International teams allow you to have your own tournament to see which country rules the hockey roost.
