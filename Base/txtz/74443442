The wackiest cartoon ever makes its debut on Dreamcast! Join Dick Dastardly, Muttley, Peter Perfect and the rest of the zany characters from the Wacky Races as 
they compete cross-country in equally crazy souped-up racing contraptions.
Get behind the wheel of one of 11 out-of-this-world vehicles ranging from the wicked Creepy Coupe driven by the Gruesome Twosome to the ultra-girly Compact Pussycat handled by the ultimate southern belle, Penelope Pitstop. Across 15 winding, tricky tracks and 3 battle arenas, players will try to trip each other up using the unique abilities of their vehicle. Each vehicle is armed with special gadgets and abilities including wacky ways to slow down, disable, and divert competitors and get past racetrack hazards. Start your engines!
