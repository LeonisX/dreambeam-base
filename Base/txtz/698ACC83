If you've ever watched those Navy barrel rollers, the Blue Angels, and wondered what it would be like to pilot a jet fighter through a wide variety of acrobatic routines, Aero Wings just might be the game for you. A different approach for flight simulators, Aerowings puts you in the cockpit of a stunt pilot working with the Blue Impulse (Japan's ìersion of the Blue Angels). You must first master the intracacies of flying each plane; then you attempt to perform intense acrobatic maneuvers, both solo and as part of a group. The ñontrol is complex - probably too complex for casual gamers, but ultimately rewarding for those who put the practice in to do some of the more complicated     
maneuvers.
