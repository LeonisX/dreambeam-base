Ripped.....: nothing

Well about one year after Kalisto released the USA version of that GeNiuS brings you the PAL 50/60Hz version. Nothing else tosay, enjoy this new title from the DoTWiN! Again we included some Covers! (gen-nhlp.zip), enjoy!
NOTE: There is sill the same problem with the intro that the US version has: It?s kinda luck if the intro works on your DC or not, its placed to the outerside of the disc but on my second DC it still won?t play :(! But who cares its just the Intro and evrything else works fine, even the CDDA, which wasn?t present on the US release! Its only one track so don?tthink of inject, its a waste of time!
Hit the ice in the coolest hockey sim. in console gaming history! NHL 2K continues the winning tradition of previous Sega Sports hits for the Sega Dreamcast arena, such as NFL 2K and NBA 2K. You'll get the same hard-hitting gameplay and gut-gripping realism for total hockey immersion. Fully licensed by the NHL and NHLPA, NHL 2K is the most realistic hockey simulation game on the market today. You can almost feel the brutal crunch of contact from a dive on the ice or an all-out brawl. Can you pull off a triple-scoring hat trick? How about a quicksilver flip pass over an unsuspecting opponent? If you've got blades of steel and nerves to match, then play that puck like a sharp-shooting pro, and score the Cup for your superstar team. Just don't get stuck in the penalty box.
