MDK with enhanced graphics, new weapons and gadgets, new playable characters, deeper storyline, focuses on different types of gameplay (i.e. puzzle solving, shoot 'em up, sneaking around). You progress through the game as a team of three characters playing each one at a time: Kurt Hectic - janitor with a sleek coil suit (good for sniping and long distance fighting), The Doctor- a
scientist, inventor, and Kurt's employer, and Max- the lovable six legged robotic dog built by the Doc. As the Doc you have to find different parts and put them together to make weapons to defeat your enemies, and as Max it's an all out gun battle. The enemies consist of a variety of aliens ranging from small, fast critters to big, hulking creatures bristling with weapons. MDK 2 also sports a unique control system with all four face buttons used for movement. Enjoy !!
