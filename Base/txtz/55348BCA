This is the German Version of the Blaze MP3 Player for Dreamcast.
This player also supports the swapping of CDs without any modchip.
There is also no need of burning the program together with your mp3s etc.!


In this release where some things I had to rip, at first the lame PC-like copy protection, and the useless dummy! Hey I mean the program is only 400kb in size, so it is faster to load this small file than seeking to the outer
area of the cd!
But I also ripped the additional free 100 track MP3 CD which was delivered with the player.

The MP3DC allows you to play MP3 CD's on your Dreamcast console! Create your own playlists and display the song and artist being played.

For those out there, that can't understand any German, here is a short description:
