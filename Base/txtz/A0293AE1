We don´t need to tell you what DEAD OR ALIVE 2 is, do we? 

It´s a nice BEAT´em UP for your lovely DC. And it´s the first copyable release ever. Make sure to use only with our previously released BootCD, and recognize that NO additional Hardware changes are required!

So rise and reverberate the name UTOPiA, history always prooved that there can only be one!

Do not care about selfproclaimed part time heros, we are with you! :) 
So no need to worry.

You can do as many copies of this image as you want using your favourite 
CDRWIN, but don´t expect to do your own copies!

Still we decided what game will be published to the masses!

Who ever will come next, always keep in mind: 

You are only immitating, next time innovate :)

Sorry for having:

FILE "G:\DEAD2.BIN" BINARY 
TRACK 02 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00 

You true heros will make it bruning on your systems, wont you?
