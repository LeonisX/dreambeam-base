- --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>

Finally here's the fix for the CDDA bug in our Dave Mirra release
(this one's not for yesterdays PAL release by Paradiso, which doesn't
play CDDA at all).

We don't assume you still got the CDI so we didn't include a PPF fix
for this game, just a working 1ST_READ.BIN. With that and your old
burned CD you need to remaster your working copy of Dave Mirra.
(If you still haven't burned Dave Mirra and got the CDI, you can
extract the data files out of the CDI with tools like the new CDmage).

Here's how todo:
----------------
+ Run the included UNPACK.EXE to get the CDDA tracks (we included
them in the fix because its not that easy to read them off the
burned CD with certain writers).
+ Copy the CD's data contents with a filemanager to your HD
+ From here on follow the steps mentioned in our Selfboot-Guide
for CDDA games, a fixed 1ST_READ.BIN and a clean IP.BIN is
provided in this release.

Note: The manual playing in this game is still pretty screwy - Live
with it. This game's CDDA routines are not the standard and you
should be thankful we spent time to make any kind of fix for it.
