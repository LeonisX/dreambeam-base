Ripped.......: Nothing

Two planetary gunships, known as mosquitoes, blaze across the face of the crimson Martian strata. The storyline is unimportant, you only need to know that you must cut a swath of destruction against all who rise in opposition. Upon starting the game, the player chooses from two mosquito ships, one with speed but light firepower and another which carries heavy guns but moves slower. A radical weapon system allows your ship to absorb oncoming buckshot by holding your fire button. Reflect this scatterfire back into the field by releasing the button and bake your aggressors with a taste of their own laser poison.
