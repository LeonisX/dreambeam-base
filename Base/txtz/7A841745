Game.....: Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition
Origin...: USA - NTSC
Released.: October 26th, 2000
Ripped.......: Nothing

Once again we bring you something that most people didn't expect to happen. This release is an MP3'd DiscJuggler Self-Booting Image. All you have to do is first run UNPACK.EXE, then run INJECT.EXE. Both of these files should come with your RAR set, there should also be a file called INFO.TRK. UNPACK.EXE will unpack WAV's from the MP3's, then INJECT.EXE will inject them into the CDI DiscJuggler Image and delete them.

So quick recap:

1. Run UNPACK.EXE
2. Run INJECT.EXE
3. Burn the .CDI as usual with DiscJuggler
4. Enjoy another fine release and scene first from ECHELON.
