Step back into a land of breathtaking beauty and challenging adventure with GRANDIA II from Game Arts. Though the game is a sequel to the much beloved Saturn classic Grandia, this title features an entirely new world with completely fresh objectives. In an intriguing and twisting plot involving dueling Gods of light and dark magic, you play as the young hero Ryudo. It's your job to escort a priestess named Elena to a special far-off ceremony in which the evil Valmar and his forces will be sealed away and prevented from causing further harm. As the important mission proceed and things begin to go terribly wrong you'll need all your might and strategic skills to survive. Do battle with fearsome monsters in highly detailed dungeons (rotating the camera 360° to see every advantage point and find hidden items) as you gain points and gather skill books and mana eggs to learn devastating magic spells and attack techniques. You’ll also explore gorgeous 3D villages and countrysides, and you’ll interact with hundreds of colorful characters in the role-playing, dungeon-crawling epic that is Grandia II.
