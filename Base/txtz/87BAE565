There are no shaved legs and skinny tires in this kind of biking. This is about busting big air tricks and landing them hard with the slap of your wheels. It's about pushing yourself to the edge and savoring the rush when you finally nail that new freestyle move. It's about the most intense, work-the-bike-for-all-it's-worth athletes in competition today. This is a game about BMX.
