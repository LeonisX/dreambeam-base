KAO Kangaroo is a rear legged stomping third person 3-D arcade style game featuring an energetic marsupial with over-developed hindquarters and an eye for a fight. This "Joey" is ready for action, willing to stomp and bop the enemies, and able to put on a major butt whooping! Armed with comedy-sized boxing gloves (what else would you expect from a Kangaroo?), KAO hops, skips, and triple jumps his way across magnificently colorful landscapes within five completely different worlds. KAO Kangaroo was kidnapped by the mischievous Hunter, and taken away from his lovely home. Now it is up to you to help KAO Kangaroo find his way back to Australia. KAO has a long journey ahead of him; unfortunately, there are a few people that would like nothing better than to keep this Kangaroo from his destination. You have total control over KAO as he ventures through incredibly detailed environments. By using KAO's powerful combination of uppercuts and 1-2 punches, he'll be just fine.
