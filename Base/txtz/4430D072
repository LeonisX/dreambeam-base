Release Notes
Ok, Back from our 16 hour break. Really funny to see most of youwhiner's reactions.Did you guys ever sit down and wonder whichgroup has given you 95% of the DC releases out there? To those of you who think we're arrogant/childish, all I can say isput your money where your mouth is, and do something about it, or don't download any of our releases.Simple as that.And to the people who can't get DJ working, do you really think wegive a fuck about your shitty burner's problem?Take what you canand if you dont like it, FUCK OFF and do it yourself. Never bite the hand that feeds you folks,otherwise you'd be stuckplaying lame NES emulators on your wonderful 128bit machines.Butits not all negative here, we'd like to say thanks to all our fansand supporters, and this game is dedicated to you. Crack Notes:The first copy protected DC game. Anchor put a 700MB file calledZ700MB.ZZZ on this game and the game failed to run without it. Nowthat file has been renamed to Z000MB.ZZZ and thats the size it is.A "real" dummy file has been added to this release already to speedup loading and it is also self-booting. (DiskJuggler fans rejoice!)Considering that the first stage of protection is defeated within thenext day of it coming out,we really have to hope that Sega & it'sdevelopers can challenge us further in the weeks to come.
