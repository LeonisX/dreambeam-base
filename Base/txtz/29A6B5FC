THE EPIC CONTINUES... IN DREAMCAST TERRITORY. 
 
In her latest adventure, the intrepid Lara Croft returns to her roots. She journeys back into the tombs of ancient Egypt to face her arch-nemesis, and also her past. Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation brings back the original atmosphere, suspense, and puzzle-oriented gameplay that made the series legendary. This time, Lara is equipped with all-new moves to face the myriad of twisted traps, creepy enemies, and mind-bending puzzles that try to stop her.
