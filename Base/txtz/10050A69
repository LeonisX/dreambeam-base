Blast-off with Dreamcast's first-ever networked title: ChuChu Rocket. It's the age-old game of cat and mouse -- with a cyber-twist. It takes only a few minutes to learn ChuChu Rocket. All you have to do is herd your ChuChus (space
mice) into their rocket before the KapuKapu (scary space cats) catch up to them. The game may seem simple, but don't be fooled. Your brain will shift into warp speed amid the fast and furious chasing, mind-bending puzzles, multiplayer teamwork, and your opponents' sneaky tricks. Catch the mystery mice and a timed event throws everyone's strategy out of whack. Whether you play solo, or play the nation, you'll get infected by ChuChu fever. 

5 fun gameplay modes : puzzle, stage challenge, four-player battle, team battle, network battle. You can also make your own puzzles.
