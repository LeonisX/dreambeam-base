WWP is all about turn-based, cartoon-style combat between warring parties of worms that fight in burrow-filled caverns or randomly generated landmasses. Create your team of worms by setting voice taunts (like "Brooklyn"), naming troops, and choosing weapons and items. Each team is assigned a number of points, which can be used to buy weapons. Your armory can include common destroyers like handguns and bazookas, bizarre contraptions like exploding sheep and mole bombs, and useful gear such as jetpacks. As many as 18 players can take part in frantic competitive or cooperative missions. If you need advice, you can always refer to your "Wormopaedia" manual for insider tips and hints as you prepare for the mayhem
of 45 single-player scenarios and 16 Time Attack Training modes. In WORMS WORLD PARTY the trash talking, worm-blasting, comedic gameplay is dripping with options.
