Title  Shenmue II
Region PAL E

ECHELON release ripped out multilanguage files and all of the free quest
speech. This wasn't entirely necessary. This release includes multilanguage
files for all discs, all disc change graphics, and a proportion of the
free quest speech depending on each disc. The free speech files also
contained important game information for when Ryo would encounter an area
he was looking for, in the ECHELON release he'd just focus on the sign and
nothing would happen. Here, you'll see what he was meant to say.

Other than that, the CDDA was ripped (only used in the opening screens) and
the Digest/Saturn movies on Disc 4 were downsampled.

Enjoy the best possible rip of Shenmue II on CD-R.
