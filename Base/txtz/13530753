Discover as much as you can about their secret project, and destroy the 'borg at all costs. Real-time character and object lighting for a greater sense of realism. Integrated storyline, character interaction, and plot progression via numerous cutscenes to draw you into the game world. Arsenal of more than 20 weapons. Pick up and use whatever you need to complete the mission: from crates and trash cans to guardrails.
