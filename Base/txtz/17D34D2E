We brought you the Japanese version a few weeks ago, now we present you the English one. Enjoy!

Imagine, if you will, a berserk B-movie, horror-film producer with a twisted sense of humor who puts up a million dollars to anyone who can survive his seven, movie-theme worlds of bloody terror. It's a bloody mess of mutant monsters, with over 1000 traps and items, and abject terror fused with B-movie humor - how can you pass up an opportunity like this? You won't really win a million bucks, but you'll get your money's worth ... of terror!
