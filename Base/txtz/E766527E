Put a high-tech robot through its paces in the fighting arena with Capcom's Tech Romancer for Sega Dreamcast. Eight different giant robots, each with their own pilots, histories, and modes of attack,can be piloted through arenas that are fully interactive. Power-ups can be discovered by destroying portions of the arena, but can also be lost if a powerful enough attack is made against your robot. The arenas are fully 3D, and a shifting landscape and camera angle helps pull you into the immersive environment. Damage and armor must be carefully managed, and knowing your 'bot's abilities can help you overcome even the most ruthless enemies.
