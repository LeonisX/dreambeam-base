Everyone knows that beautiful fireworks displays illuminate the skies over the Walt Disney World Resort. But did you know that it's all run by an enormous, amazing contraption - the Fireworks Machine. But those inquisitive chipmunks, Chip 'n Dale, have accidentally caused the machine to explode -- if they don't put the machine back together before the end of the day, there won't be any fireworks shows!

Chip's idea is to race around Walt Disney World Resort and collect all the pieces of the Fireworks Machine. If they get some friends to help too, they could find all the parts and put the machine back together in no time! You'll be speeding around 13 raceways based on popular Walt Disney World Theme Parks and Water Parks, including famous attractions like Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, and The Jungle Cruise!
