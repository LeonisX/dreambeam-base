Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
SURRENDER IS NOT AN OPTION. 
This battle takes place in the new wild frontier: SPACE. Man\'s ability to terraform planets has drawn the unwanted attention of the Charva aliens from a distant galaxy. As the Millennium Soldier, you must battle the aggressive aliens in an all-out war of the worlds. Travel through the lush texture-mapped environments that look incredible on Sega Dreamcast. Use the Clones to help you free the colonies from their alien invaders. Expendable\'s Charva population is superior in speed and intelligence to humans, and they can breathe oxygen. Not only that, but they can survive in gasses normally fatal to humans. They do, however, have a weakness - they can\'t see too well, especially peripherally. So, grab your pulse rifle and endless supply of ammo and sneak up alongside these leathery bad boys. Will Planet Earth remain as we know it? Or will it become Planet Charva? It\'s up to you! 

- Incredible 3D effects, including 360-degree texture-mapped environments and 3D blasting.
- 20 missions in six diverse environments, plus four bonus levels. 
- One- or two-player mode.
- Unique two-player mode for cooperative play.
- Huge stockpile of weapons, including napalm, flame throwers, lasers, and grenades.
