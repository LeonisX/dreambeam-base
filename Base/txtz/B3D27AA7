Are you the fastest person in the world? You can find out by racing against sprinter Maurice Greene, who became the fastest human on Earth when he shattered the 100-meter world record in Athens, Greece, last year. Greene will be facing off against other world-class speedsters during the 2000 Summer Olympic Games this September in Sydney, Australia, and you'll have a similar opportunity by immersing yourself in the ESPN International Track & Field game for the Sega Dreamcast.
