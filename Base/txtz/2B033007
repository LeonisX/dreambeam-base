START REVVING. 
Experience the nose-to-tail battle that is CART racing. This high-speed, action-packed racing game will pump your pulse into overdrive with its 3D realism and challenging courses. Sega's first-ever CART simulation brings the world's fastest closed-circuit auto racing to Sega Dreamcast. Fully licensed by CART and designed with the help of CART's champion Team Rahal, Sega has created the most accurate and realistic racing game yet for console gaming. Hold on tight as you race through 19 real-life tracks and confront a variety of weather and road conditions. Details such as debris hitting your windshield will make you forget about that static chair you're sitting in. So step on the gas and don't stop till you screech across the finish line.
