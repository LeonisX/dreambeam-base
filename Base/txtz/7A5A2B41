IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a Japanese, Asian, or European Dreamcast  you will have to get the Country Fix PPF from the E-UCHAOS.ZIP file  which we are putting out aside this release. If you do not apply the  PPF inside this ZIP, the game will not work on a Non-American DC. If you have a USA DC, you should be able to play this game fine without applying the PPF, but all others must apply the PPF or the game will not even boot. Also please note that this game has slow loading times, which are also present on the original.

THESE COPS HAVE NO TIME TO KILL.

The new millennium approaches. Turmoil, crime, and famine rule. Gangs, terrorists and violent cults lurk around every corner. As one of two cops, you must try and bring order to the city. D'arci is a young and cunning super-sleuth with unsurpassed econnaissance and infiltration skills. As Special Forces veteran, Roper is known for his expertise in weapons and explosives. His skills are never questioned, but his mental stability is.

Either one could be the hero this city is waiting for.

But time is running out...
