What's Up. The name is vision, and I just created a fan based Strider game called Strider X. It's for the PC and Dreamcast. It's a beat 'em up that contains lots of Strider Edits from all over the net. If you want to check it out

it's not based on the origional story, but it tells a new story to add a twist to the real story I was wondering if any one could port it to the Xbox I have the source code addad to the download . thanks , later
