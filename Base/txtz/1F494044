 Release Notes 
This project has finally reached its final v.1.0 release.
You will find hours of Counter-Strike gameplay, now on Sega Dreamcast. This final release is now very stable, and is fully playable with a standard controller.

And for the record, this project was intended from the begining to be a great single-player experience.  So to answer with certainty, online/multiplayer will never be possible on Dreamcast.         
  
Standard half-life dc codes work from the menu, for example:
"Otis Loves Dreamcast" --> God mode
"Dreamcast Gives Firepower" --> Infinate ammo

Also, huge credit goes to original authors of the content that has been borrowed with or without permission for this release.
