SATURDAY MORNING EVERY MORNING! 
Welcome to the off-the-wall world of brothers Hoigle and Moigle Floigan! In this lighthearted adventure game, you'll help the large and lovable Moigle build his "Secret Project" in hopes of keeping the greedy Baron Malodorous and his gang of Mercenary Cats from taking over the Floigan junkyard. In Floigan Brothers Moigle's Secret Project for Dreamcast, you assume the role of Hoigle Floigan, the quick-witted older brother, who engages the completely interactive Moigle in a series of puzzles, games, and adventures while retrieving the lost parts for his project. Moigle is passionate and sensitive, and his emotional reactions continue the flow of the game. For example, you'll encounter a river with a low bridge that the brothers must cross. Hoigle must do something to make Moigle cry so his tears fill up the river and raise the bridge allowing passage. You are challenged to teach Moigle new things along the way. The knowledge Moigle gains is retained on the Visual Memory Unit (VMU) and you can trade him for other Moigles over the Internet. Each Moigle is made up of unique personality traits, creating a completely different gameplay experience with each trade!
