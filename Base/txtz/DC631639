Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
The wackiest cartoon ever makes its debut on Dreamcast! Join Dick
Dastardly, Muttley, Peter Perfect and the rest of the zany characters
from the Wacky Races as they compete cross-country in equally crazy
souped-up racing contraptions. 

Get behind the wheel of one of 11 out-of-this-world vehicles ranging
from the wicked Creepy Coupe driven by the Gruesome Twosome to
the ultra-girly Compact Pussycat handled by the ultimate southern
belle, Penelope Pitstop. 

Across 15 winding, tricky tracks and 3 battle arenas, players will 
try to trip each other up using the unique abilities of their
vehicle.

Each vehicle is armed with special gadgets and abilities including 
wacky ways to slow down, disable, and divert competitors and get
past racetrack hazards.

Players can choose to race from six different modes including
Wacky Cups, Straight Race, Time Trial and Versus. Start your 
engines!
