From Simon & Schuster Interactive, Who Wants to Beat Up a 
Millionaire is a parody of the wildly successful television show, 
Who Wants to be a Millionaire. The game pokes fun at Millionaire's 
dramatic music, lighting, and of course. . . final answer. . . its 
host, Regis Philbin. 

One to four players compete in a hilarious game show-style showdown, 
where the last millionaire standing is the winner. The object of 
the game is to inflict enough physical, psychological, and 
emotional harm upon your opponent's millionaire to eliminate them 
from the game. 

If a player gets a question correct, he or she can choose which 
millionaire will get beaten up. The harder the question, the more 
damage is inflicted and the last millionaire standing is the winner!
