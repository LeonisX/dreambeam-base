Ripped nothing

Eighteen wheels, 20 tons of cargo, 60 feet of truck,  and 10,000 miles of highway - looks like you're gonna need a little more coffee! Travel down the highway behind the wheel of one of 4 Big-Rigs, each with its own unique level of speed, torgue and toughness. Race against rival Big-Rigs and the clock as you haul cargo across the nation in a no-holds-barred driving battle. Saddle up to 300 horsepower and choose the driver who'll take you from pick-up to delivery as quickly as possible. But be careful, the more damage you recieve, the less your load is worth - and the other trucker are sure to give you more than a run for your money. Go on, get that diesel hummin'...the counrtyside and your opponents await.
