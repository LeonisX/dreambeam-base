Run Inject.exe there is no unpack.exe. No one ever said marriage was 
easy especially not for the King of Gomar. His wife, distraught over 
the death of her son, started using black magic in a last-ditch 
effort to bring him back to life. Together with her other son, Felies,
they cast spells until a suspicious mist crept over the land, turning 
the town's people into vicious beasts. These ravaging animals attack
with a battle cry that will make your hair stand up. There are five
huge worlds in Soul Fighter to battle in and the graphics and effects 
look amazing on Sega Dreamcast. The King banishes his wife and son 
from the kingdom, before they can do further damage, with the help of 
three warriors. Atlus, the king's leading knight; Sayomi, a female 
spy; and Orion, a wizard, must fight to restore order to Gomar and 
save the innocent souls caught up in this beastly mayhem.
