Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
Pinki and her evil gang have taken over Pao Pao Park and it's up to Super Magnetic Neo to set things right! A robotic superhero with magnetic powers, Neo can shift his polarity at will to push or pull objects and enemies.

By timing his powerful blasts Super Magnetic Neo can launch himself off platforms, swing along treacherous vines, and rocket across elevated skyways! He is the ultimate head-trip and it's the most bizarre videogame ever seen. It's addictive, it's fun...and it's only on the Dreamcast!
