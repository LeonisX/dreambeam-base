Introducing Sonic Adventure 2, the latest Sonic masterpiece, where you play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles and attempt to save the world-OR-play as Shadow, Dr. Robotnik, or Rouge and conquer all who stand in your way. Mistaken for a villain and kidnapped by a military squad, Sonic must escape his captors and discover who is responsible for all his trouble. Jump into the action and check out Sonic's new moves as he grinds rails, swings from poles, and somersaults past the bad guys.
