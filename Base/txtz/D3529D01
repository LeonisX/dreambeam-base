Nothing. 

Buckle up - it's sheer asphalt anarchy! Crazy Taxi screeches onto DC with one wild and hilarious joy-riding
jaunt. As a fearless cabbie with attitude, you're driven by a single goal: to rack up the mega-bucks in fares and
tips before your shift ends. It's a race against the clock as you pick up passengers and white-knuckle it through busy streets and back alleys to their various destinations. To keep that meter collecting cash, you've gotta take the fastest route possible, even if it means bending the traffic laws - just a little. Drive the wrong way down a one-way street, catch air as you sail over rooftops, swerve between oncoming traffic, or plough through a pavement cafe. But beware - the city is full of obstacles that are guaranteed to slow you down. And time is money! So get a grip on the wheel, sharpen your senses, and don't lose your cool.
