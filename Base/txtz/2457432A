When bounty hunters rule the streets and human organs serve as the most valuable form of currency, something has to change. That’s where you come in. You’re Jack Wade, and you’ve got a score to settle. After awakening from a long coma, you stared at the blank institutional walls and realized that someone had stolen your precious memories, your mind, and your complete identity. The only option you’re left with is to trek through your past in an attempt to give yourself some sort of future. Along with an accomplice, the lovely Angela Stern, you’ll make your way through dozens of levels by way of foot and motorcycle. There are plenty of high-tech weapons to collect along your journey--including mines, machine guns, missile launchers, and more--and dozens of hidden game features to unlock. All the while, you’ll enjoy a cinematic in-game soundtrack from Richard Jaques and The London Philharmonic Orchestra.
