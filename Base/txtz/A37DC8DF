Game.....: San Francisco Rush 2049 * Cracked * (C) Midway / Atari
Origin...: USA - NTSC
Released.: September 20th, 2000
Ripped.......: Music Downsampled

- --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------> 

Echelon has come through again, with this fully cracked quality release.

This game had a total of 4 copy protections.  It's the first serious attempt at protecting a game - UFC, which Kalisto cracked, was hardly serious :).  It took several crackers and about 2 weeks for us to finally get this done.  We've learned a lot from this. Hopefully it won't take so long next time.

In non-protection news, this game had to have its music downsampled.
It was just too big.  No FMVs were downsampled; not that there were
many anyway.

***NOTE TO SEGA***:  Did you know that Midway violated the developer
agreement by doing a kernel RAM checksum?  If future Dreamcasts were
to have a different GD-ROM kernel, the legitimate Rush 2049 would not work on it.  If you approved it, that's fine then.
   
Last thing.  Sorry about DDR Club Mix's botched NFO.  It should have said that crappy songs were downsampled to 8 bit and/or mono, and that the release requires an 80 minute CD-R.
