Nothing.

After a meteor crashes into the planet insects and reptiles are transformed into oversized monsters. Players take
on the role of a member of the specialization group who is going to destroy the newly created behemoths. As players switch between weapons they have the option to charge a weapon before each shot which is where
the title of the game comes from. Play as Jhon Down, Nicholas Woods or Pamela Hewitt, each with their own weapons systems. Tackle the foes in shooter-style levels alone or with a friend. Time Attack mode will have you racing against the clock to complete each level.
