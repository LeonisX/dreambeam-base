In the sequel to Blood Omen Legacy of Kain, you jump into the world of Raziel, a member of Kain’s vampire army. After defying Kain’s authority, you were sentenced to damnation in the Lake of the Dead. Your body has been torn apart by water that acts like acid on vampires; you are merely a shell of your former self. As a member of the undead ranks, you have the ability to pass between the Spectral Plane and the Material Plane as you seek revenge on your former master. But you’ll notice that the two realms are vastly different, as are your abilities in each, which you’ll have to use to your advantage on your quest for vengeance. On both planes you’ll find plenty of puzzles to solve, platforms to jump, and enemies to fight as you traverse through the two planes and hunt down Kain.
