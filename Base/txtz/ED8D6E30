Release Notes
Today we bring you another quality title & rip. This time its TechRomancer from Capcom ripped to perfection. This game had 1.2GB of data which was mostly custom formats. We had to downsample the audio to 22 KHZ and edit the EXE so it would adapt to that. Also all theFMV had its bitrate changed to make this monster fit. It now weighsin at 75 Minutes and an overburn is definitely possible. Enjoy another quality rip from your friends at KALISTO.
