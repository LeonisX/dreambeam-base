Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
A BLOODY GOOD TIME.
Cover up that neck 'cause five clans of vampires are out to get you! Loyal to their master, Kain, these bloodsuckers will do anything to protect him and his dynasty. As Raziel, you're determined to kill the evil master who created you. The realistic, beautifully gothic landscapes, made even more fantastic by the power of Sega Dreamcast, are riddled with mystery and danger. In Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,
the magic lands of ghastly ghouls are alive with instant karma as well! The nonplayer characters remember how you treat them and react accordingly, so watch out -- some horrors you bring on yourself. You will engage in death-defying, hand-to-hand combat, so make full use of the weapons and spells. 

- Fluid graphics.
