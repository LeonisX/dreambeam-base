THE ICE AGE IS BACK!
Hit the ice in the coolest hockey sim. in console gaming history! NHL 2K continues the winning tradition of previous Sega Sports hits for the Sega Dreamcast arena, such as NFL 2K and NBA 2K. You'll get the same hard-hitting gameplay and gut-gripping realism for total hockey immersion. Fully licensed by the NHL and NHLPA, NHL 2K is the most realistic hockey simulation game on the market today. You 
can almost feel the brutal crunch of contact from a dive on the ice or an all-out brawl. Can you pull off a triple-scoring hat trick? How about a quicksilver flip pass over an unsuspecting opponent? If you've got blades of steel and nerves to match, then play that puck like a sharp-shooting pro, and score the Cup for your superstar team. Just don't get stuck in the penalty box.
