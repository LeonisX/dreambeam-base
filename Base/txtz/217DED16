MAY THE BEST PODRACER WIN!

In this race-in-space thrill ride you'll hurtle through the Star Wars 
Galaxy at simulated speeds of up to 600 mph! Star Wars: Episode I
Racer puts you in the cockpit as Anakin, the evil Sebulba, or any one 
of 21 other Podracer pilots. Race in environments right out of the 
movie, as well as a few more from outside of Tatooine. This fast and
furious battle on Sega Dreamcast is light years ahead of other
versions, with higher frame-rate and resolution so images are sharper 
than ever. There are over 20 sleek Podracers, each with unique
handling mechanics, and the higher you rank, the better your choice
of lightening quick racers. For that winning edge, throw your speed
demon into Thrust Mode and your opponents will think you got sucked
into a black hole, 'cuz you'll leave them to eat your asteroid dust!
Practice up so you can enter the Star Wars World Rankings Contests 
where you'll battle against gamers worldwide and win cool stuff!
