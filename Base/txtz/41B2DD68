THE TERRORISTS ARE TOAST. 

So many terrorists, so little time. The deadly deviants in Outtrigger don't stand a chance against Interforce, the International Counter Terrorism Special Forces. Not only are you among the elite-trained specialists, but you also have flame-throwers, photon torpedoes, and rocket launchers at your disposal. Assume the role of Jay, Alain, Lina, or Talon and discover their special skills. This fast-paced, 3D Deamcast battle keeps your blood pumping as you blast through each unique level. 
Complete your mission and move onto a new battle arena - a library, castle, abandoned train station, and more. Whether you enter the action at home with your friends or online against other gamers across the nation, Outtrigger will immerse you in the world of high crime and punishment.

Notes:

Yesterday we brought you the European 50/60 HZ Multi-Language release. Today, we bring you the American version which is only 60 HZ and English. The main reason we are releasing the American version is because it has SegaNet support and you can play online with this one. Online Play was lacking from the European version. Have fun with the game and thanks to the guy who supplied this one a few days ahead of retail.
