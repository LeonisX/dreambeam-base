Ripped.......: Some CDDA Tracks

GO SPILL SOME PLASMA. 
Plasma Sword continues Capcom's winning string of fighting games for Sega Dreamcast; it is the direct successor to the critical hit Star Gladiator. Battle for supremacy among 22 different aliens in the mental apocalypse occurring on Earth hundreds of years in the future. Each alien's specialized moves and super combo attacks, rendered in 3D at 60 frames per second by the Dreamcast's superior hardware, inflicts awe-inspiring devastation on the screen. Both single and multi-player modes are available, including Group Battle Mode, where you can choose 5 different fighters to terrorize all comers to the field. Don't just kill your opponents, wipe them out by turning them into superheated hydrogen ions. Ouch. 

Game Features:
- 3-D rendered alien fighters and battlefields. 
- Special attack combos and super combos. 
- Revolutionary features, such as the Plasma Field Attack and  Plasma Revenge. 
- Several modes of play, including Group Battle Mode. 
- Horizontal and vertical-attack weapons. 
- Defensive maneuvers such as strafing and blocking.

Rip Notes:
This game had nearly 80 Minutes of CDDA. We had to rip out some of the music tracks, however, we did not leave the game silent during those places. Rather we re-routed the CDDA to other tracks that do still exist on this rip. It's the best that could be done for a 60 CDDA track beast like this one, Enjoy.
