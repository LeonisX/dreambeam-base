Sega and Silicon Dreams are on the ball to bring Sega WorldWide Soccer 2000 to dreamcast. The beautiful game is brought to life in this fast action packed soccer
simulation. Put on your old school kit and challenge all your friends - (up to four people can play). The European edition of this game is more than just an update, it's a whole new playing and visual experience. More detail has been applied to the players features (face, kit, even hair) and the way that they move in the game. In addition free kick and corner tactics can be saved to your VM and there is a speed slider so that 
you can customise the speed of the action.
