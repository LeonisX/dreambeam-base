Описание: Many bad things have been said about this French only Dreamcast release but it's not all that bad. I've only cleared the first 4 of 20 (I think) stages but so far it hasn't been that bad. The game is loosely based on the movie set in a race against the clock type of way with the odd variation to the style of play every now and then. The game's graphics are OK but nothing that would make you say WOW !! There is one annoying thing about the camera view used though. Blue Sphere have decided to use a sort of Fish Eye view which makes everything distort to a long looking shape the closer it get to the screen. I really hate this effect but that could just be me. Anyway, the game controls quite well as long as the in-car view is used, since the out-side views don't seem to control to well. Music is ok but nothing great. It does seem to add to the atmosphere of the game though. All in all I'd say Taxi 2 is a decent enough game if you can find it cheap, which I seriously doubt unless you make a trip to France to pick up this now rare Dreamcast title. I was lucky to have my friend in France find this used copy for me pretty cheap.
