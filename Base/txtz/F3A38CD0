After some unexpected delays, DCEvolution.net finally brings you the ultimate Beats of Rage collection, featuring some of the finest mods the BoR world has to offer:
Beats of Rage Remix, Hatchet Ninjaz, Hyper Final Fight 1 & 2, Alien vs Predator, Dragons of Rage, Double Dragon Extreme & Rage of the Streets - the awesome work of modders like Mr.Q, Kingherb, Vision, AxelBlazeAdam and Hokutoy - all presented on one huge disc!
We've put a lot of work into this project and added small bugfixes and extra features to almost every mod in this compilation.
The games use the BoR game engine created by Senile Team, ported to DC by Neill Corlett and re-vamped by L@ Cible. That means full rumble support and 50Hz PAL / 60Hz NTSC selection.
Enjoy playing your favorite BoR mods again or discover what you've missed!
