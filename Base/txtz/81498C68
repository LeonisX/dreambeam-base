Оригинальное описание/релиз: You're cruising along a freeway in Tokyo when you see someone challenging you out of the corner of your eye. You flash your headlights, take on the dare, and you're off speeding down the highway in TOKYO XTREME RACER. Compete one-on-one in a series of sprints, which take place on two different Japanese highways. Your goal is simple: lead your opponent for a longer period of time than he is able to lead you. Each driver has a meter that begins to count down when they are trailing. The farther the winning car is ahead, the faster the trailing car's meter runs down; the first meter to run out loses. Customize your car's stats and improve its performance if you’re not winning like you think you should be. Beware of hitting dividers and walls, as they will drag your vehicle down costing you valuable speed. Earn money when you beat opponents and use it to upgrade your car, so you'll be ready to take on faster members of Tokyo's toughest racing gangs in TOKYO XTREME RACER.
