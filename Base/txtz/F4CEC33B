Hi! This is the boot loader 1.2 release, with covers for it. The format is Diskjuggler 3, but from http://cdirip.freeyellow.com you can convert it to a nero image if you don't have DJ3.
Alternitivly you could download diskjuggler 3.
Just a bit of information about my site and how its coming along. I am hoping to get it up and officialy fully working by Saturday March 10th, but look out in february as things will start to get interesting. The site's address will be http://www.dcgdemu.com
Currently I am working on the second release of GD Toolbox and a few other applics. For now though i am sending my work to www.dccopyworld.com and hoping they will post it, as the are the best site for patches, applics e.t.c! Keep up the good work guys!
