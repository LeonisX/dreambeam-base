The player commences the game with one plane available, the F-5E Tiger II. This plane is a middle of the road,
single engine fighter that offers moderate mobility and slower speeds. Players take to the skies in this puppy,
and dole out tons of love in the form of missiles and nose-mounted machine gun fire. Kiss the other guy enough times, and he will swoon for you as he nose dives into the nearby mountains or pavement. As you develop your fighter-piloting prowess, new planes are unlocked and money money-money-money (mun-aye) is deposited into the player's top secret account for the spending. This brings an element of resource management into the dynamics
of the gameplay. With all that loot, players can then augment their compliment of aircraft by purchasing upwards
of 30 different fighter planes. Included in the mix are the Migs, the A-10, the F-14, F-15 and F-16, as well as stealth craft. What is nice about all these planes, is that Konami has done a sweet job of making sure that they each handle differently and are therefore applicable to certain types of sorties one must fly to advance.

And as you move through the game, one high point is definitely mission variety. Your objectives run the full gamut, from escorts to bombing runs in canyons, train yards, airfields and prison camps. One thing that was not included, as expected, was the ability to load out your plane with various armaments. In hindsight, who needs that, when you start each mission with like...sixty (count 'em 60) missiles! Well, in all honesty, it is an arcade-style flight simulation...didn't I mention that?
