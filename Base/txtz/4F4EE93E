Nothing. 

If you liked DYNAMITE COP in the arcade, then you're going to love it on your Dreamcast. In this fast-paced side-
scroller, you play as one of three dynamite cops who have been selected for a mission of national security. A cruise ship has been hijacked by a group of vagabond pirates, and one of the hostages just happens to be the
President's daughter. Pick your fighter and choose from three different attack plans, then get ready for the fight of your life. Even though this is a solo mission, you'll have plenty of weapons available to make your job a little easier. If traditional weapons aren't your style, then take advantage of the environment and use whatever you can find as a weapon: huge potted plants, oversized tuna, and even a urinal. If you can pick it up, then it's fair game. You can also try your hand at the Survival mode, Versus mode, and the arcade classic Tranquilizer Gun.
