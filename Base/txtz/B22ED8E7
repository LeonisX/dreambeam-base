The horror returns to Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 from Capcom. You play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or as Claire Redfield, who's searching for her brother Chris.
The Umbrella Corporation has unleashed the devastating T-virus that has infected the city and transformed the populace into flesh-rending zombies. You take control of Leon or Claire in separate adventures that ultimately
intertwine and affect one another; the decisions you make and paths you take as Claire have repercussions for Leon's adventure (and vice-versa). Along the way you can unlock hidden characters (like the survivor Tofu), solve frightening and challenging puzzles, and shoot your way through swarms of vile undead. Enjoy all the sights, sounds, and moods of classic horror films like the echoing crunch of footsteps, quiet moans of waiting zombies, and eerie howls.
