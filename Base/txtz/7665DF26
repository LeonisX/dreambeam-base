That endless conflict between well-armed, strategically minded earth dwellers is about to spill over onto your Dreamcast, with WORMS: Armageddon. Choose a team of earthworms and use their arsenal of 55 wacky weapons, including exploding sheep, nuclear bombs, jet packs, and more, to survive all-out war in 30 single-player missions against the CPU. When your combat strategies are beyond reproach, lead your worms onto the field of battle, one of a billion randomly generated maps, against a friend's team for a little two-player action! Or you can also join forces with your rival and take on the devious CPU team. The personality of your team will come out in 60 custom soundbanks, featuring comical voice samples that punctuate each successful attack or failed defense. Cunning and skill will take priority over speed and reflexes in the strategic battle that is WORMS: Armageddon.
