MOVE OVER EXCALIBUR! 
Maken X goes above and beyond the usual slicefest. In this first-person adventure on Sega Dreamcast, you play as Maken X, aka "Soul Sword." This powerful entity can "brain-jack," or take over, the minds and bodies of other characters. Inhabiting a new body not only boosts your strength, but also lets you access its unique powers. The ability to manipulate a person's "psi," or 
soul, was discovered in a research lab and promptly hidden in the Soul Sword. Terrorists have kidnapped the chief scientist, and his daughter Kay has awakened Maken X to assist her in rescuing her father. As the quest continues, Maken and Kay go up against a slew of disturbing, evil characters in real-time, sword-slinging combat. As Maken, you definitely have the sharper edge in this contest of wills. But you must rely on skill and strategy to 
finish with all your limbs attached. There are 7 different endings to this slasher, so your every move will decide your ultimate fate.

Rip Notes:
All Japanese voices had to go from this one, and the remaining English voices & music were converted to Mono to make this monster fit tightly on an 80 Minute Blank. The Japanese voices are never used in the game, it is hardcoded to use English voices. Also, this game is a bit over the size that would be needed to make it a self-booting DiscJuggler image, and there'ss nothing left to rip. If you want to self-boot it, you might have success doing it using our previously released toolkit and either overburning an 80 Minute Blank or using a 90/99 Minute Blank. We did not want to make either of those a requirement for burning this release, though. So use the Utopia loader for this one and burn it in CDRWIN.
