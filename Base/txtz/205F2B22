Rip notes: Nothing Was Ripped

Get ready for some of the strangest selection of fighters ever to grace a video game, in this sequel to the Saturn
classic.

Forget normal weapons, the tools of destruction range from skateboards to a bike and even a fluffy teddy in this game by AM2. Based on the Virtua Fighter engine, this game includes an armour system which can be damaged by your opponents, or ripped of by your character to perform a super charged move to send the enemy flying out of the ring.

Test your moves in the training mode to improve your combos or take on a friend in the VS mode, the choice is yours.
