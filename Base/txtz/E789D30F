Rip notes: This is a rip of the CNN release.

Featuring graphics that surpass everything so far on DC, Soul Calibur is the martial arts fighting game to end all fighting games and the game to get if you're a DC owner.
Based on the arcade classic of the same name, it lets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. If you can successfully defeat all of your opponents, you will then face the fiendish Inferno in a final showdown that will determine the fate of the world. Each of the game's warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon -sword, axe, stave, nunchaku, and so on- and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels.
