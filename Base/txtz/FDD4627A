Release Notes
Some CDDA had to be ripped from this gigantic game to make it fit  tightly on an 80 Minute CD. However, as usual - It was rerouted to  play other tracks so there is no silence. Enjoy this nice game with music.

Now, the sequel to the wildly popular arcade game Virtual On comes  to the Dreamcast in this perfect detail-by-detail version. You won't believe how exact, how frantic and explosive this game is! 

Once again, giant virtuoids rule the arena, each with a unique  weapons array and thirst for destruction. They only have one thing in mind. Your extinction!
