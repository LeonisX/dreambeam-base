Game.....: Skies Of Arcadia (C) Sega / Overworks
Origin...: EUROPE - NTSC
Released.: August 8th, 2001
Ripped.......: Nothing

Echelon is proud to present to you our latest masterpiece in ripping.
This game was originally 2 full GD-ROM's. Each were over 1GB in size.
We now give you this whole game in a simple 1.4 GB download that fits
on 2 80 Minute CDs with no content downsampled or modified. 
 
Other people may have tried to split this game up on several CDs, but
the swap points were simply a pain in the ass to use and find. We
never attempted splitting this game, as its nature does not allow
for that to be done efficiently.

We decided to take a new approach to this game. We have once
again revolutionized the way rips are made on consoles and made
history. We compressed all of the game data on this game, and coded
an on-the-fly decompressor to be run whenever data is read from
the CD. After some optimizations and fooling around, this ended up
working surprisingly well. The load times are not as bad as you
might think, and the game is very playable. The only glitch that
you might notice in this game is that the music sometimes starts
to skip during cutscenes because it cannot be streamed fast enough.
There is nothing that can be done about this, but it is very minor
and only happens on some cutscenes.
 
So, today we present you this latest masterpiece in ripping and set
a new standard for how rips are done in the future. This is the
European version which is Multi-Language. It contains the following
languages: English, French, Spanish, and German. It is already
forced to display in 60 HZ. We also included a nice +16 Trainer on 
this release for your convenience. It includes the following options:
