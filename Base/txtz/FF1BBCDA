Crime is out of control in Union City, its down to D'arci Stern, a rookie cop from UCPD, to clean the mean streets and bring down the Wildcats gang. As the story unfolds you find out that all is not what it seems in this mix of Tomb Raider and GTA. 
 
Starting with the training missions, you'll learn the basic skills required to police the streets, fighting and driving. When completed the whole city is there to be explored as you are given missions to clear by your commanding officer. 
 
These range from arresting gang members, recovering stolen vehicles and even stopping a suicidal jumper, as you struggle to take down the Wildcats.
 
Search the people you have killed/arrested for ammo and power-ups but watch out for the innocent by-standers, your a cop after all.
