Release Notes
Here it is folks, the sequel to one of the greatest game ever made!
We dedicate this release to our diehard fans, the ones love seeing
our intros, and realize that Echelon is the only true name in the
Dreamcast scene.

Make sure you check out our latest (and most likely last) intro for
the Dreamcast.There's even a hidden section, (we had one in our
trainer menu as well, but it seems noone has figured it out yet) 

Game Information:

Ace the competition with Sega Sports Tennis 2K2! Now you can choose from 16 internationally ranked men's and women's tennis players to compete in singles, doubles, and even mixed doubles matches! 

The revamped World Circuit Mode lets you create and train your player, sign unique doubles partners, and enter a host of prestigious tournaments. Lob, slice, and smash your way to victory with intuitive pick-up-and-play controls designed to cater to all levels of gamers. 

Just remember to keep your eye on the ball. Tennis 2K2's intense four-player action might distract you from noticing the large variety of beautifully rendered stadiums along with the multiple playing surfaces. But who could ignore the new and improved cross-court shots, diving saves, and devastating drop shots? 

Greetings to SJ who promised to buy a DC to play this game :p and to Jim Courrier who is MIA from this new version of the game! JIm where are you?? come back!
