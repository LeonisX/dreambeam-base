Release Notes

SO MANY CARS, SO LITTLE TIME.

Ever wanted to push the world's hottest dream cars to their limits to see how they perform? Now's your chance. Just hop into a Lotus GT-1 or Jaguar XKR and race around the world. In this latest incarnation of the wildly popular racing series, Test Drive 6 is more realistic than ever before. A completely revamped physics model gives each car in its class a specific driving style and handling.  
Unexpected obstacles, collidable objects, and hairy shortcuts will challenge your stamina and skill. Crash through an outdoor cafe in Paris and send the tables airborne, or smash rickshaws in the back alleys of Hong Kong. High-res graphics look awesome on Sega Dreamcast, and environment-specific sounds bring the tracks to life.

- Collidable objects, in-road obstacles, and nerve-racking shortcuts. 
- New "all-units" AI has the police working together to take you down  in force.
- New economic racing system makes you earn those credits.
- Purchase, upgrade, and stockpile cars in your custom garage.
- Huge jumps and high-impact collisions.
- Unpredictable cross traffic.
