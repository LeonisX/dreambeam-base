This neat little DC App comes pre-loaded with codes for 12 of DC's best games. Simply burn this image in DiscJuggler and load it in your Dreamcast. From there you can select which game you want to u codes on, OR you can select No Codes and use it to boot ANY origin Import DC Game. So, basically this app serves 2 purposes, cheats and a 'software-based' modchip. =)
