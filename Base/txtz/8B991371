Miscellaneous Notes:
- Yes, this pack is based off an emulator that Sega coded.
- The emulator requires a lot of tweaking to get games that are not included on this pack to run correctly.
- If we have time for it, we will probably do this tweaking over the next few days and release a menu system to launch your own ROM's and burn them to a CD.
- For all of those wondering, the DC console that comes with this pack (when you buy it!) DOES play MIL CD's / copies.
- You will all probably be wondering how to exit out of a game once you start it, simply press A+B+X+Y simultaneously, then hit Start to return back to the menu system.
- Regards to Uncle Sonic for his help, you know for what!
