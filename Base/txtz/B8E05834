Game : ECW: Hardcore Revolution
Origin : USA - NTSC
Released : July 10th, 2000

EXTREME IS NOT A MISNOMER.
Extreme Championship Wrestling -- replete with barbwire ropes and some pretty nasty-looking weapons of mass mayhem -- comes to Sega Dreamcast in the aptly titled ECW Hardcore Revolution. With 40 different wrestlers to choose from (or you can create your own), each with their own unique fighting style and stock of bloodied props, this game promises to be for wrestling fans what caffeine is for game programmers: lifeblood. Also featured are three different venues, with over 20 different types of matches, including I Quit, Gauntlet, and the ever-popular First Blood. So come on down, and beat your friend's head into virtual pulp!

- Hear! - the wrestlers use language that would make sailors blush!
- See! - the referees run for cover! 
- Revel! - in gouts of blood spraying across the entire ring!
- Play one of 40 professional wrestlers, or design your own. 
- Use a variety of "beater props": everything from kendo sticks to 
 cheese graters.
- Barbwire and steel cage matches.
