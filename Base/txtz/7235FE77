THE SKY'S THE LIMIT. 

Imagine a world where people live on islands, float through the air and use masterfully engineered sky-ships to travel from place to place. Follow the adventures of the young hero Vyse, as he struggles with his place as a member of the noble Blue Rogues. Vyse's journeys take him through uncharted skies to discover new continents and explore mystical ruins. Through his voyage he will wage epic battles against savage monsters, evil Pirates, and a powerful enemy nation. Accompanying Vyse on his quest will be Aika, his childhood friend, and Fina, a mysterious girl from a distant land. Skies of Arcadia delivers a brilliantly animated cast of characters, monsters and villains, along with astounding 3D graphic environments and a wonderfully scripted story line.

- Full 3D world with highly imaginative storyline, beautifully detailed graphics and stunning gameplay.
