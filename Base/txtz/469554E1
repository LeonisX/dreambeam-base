------------                                           
After being kidnapped from his beautiful home, Kao must find his way back to australia. Armed with comedy-sized boxing gloves, Kao hops, skips, and triple jumps his way across magnificently colored landscapes. Legs the size of a professional bodybuilders aren't the only means of locomotion for this furry bundle of fury. Use hang gliders, motorboats, snowboards, and even a space 
scooter.
