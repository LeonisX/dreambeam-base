If it seems to you like Evil Twin Cyprien's Chronicles is more like an animated feature than a videogame, that’s because it was originally planned as a feature film. The game is based on the surreal dreamworlds of a boy named Cyprien, who gets trapped there and has to battle his way out with your help, of course. At the start of the game all you’ll have to fight with is a slingshot with unlimited ammo, but you’re going to need more than that to get very far. Your real secret weapon is that Cypreien can turn into Super Cyprien a super-powered and nearly invulnerable version of himself who has loads of special powers. The reason Cypreien is trapped is because of his nightmares, and it’s your task to lead him through six different islands and face the evil on each in order to return to the real world.
