DCEvolution.net proudly presents a ready-to-burn Special Dreamcast Edition of bWWd's fantastic Battletoads!

While the game itself is identical to the initial release, a lot of changes and optimizations have been made to technical structure so now it finally runs from start to end in all game modes - without the RAM saving enabled!

In addition all other reported bugs in the original version have been fixed - Namely all slowdowns and the transparency problems with the cutscenes in the 'Zombie Party' game mode.


The game itself took eight long months to create and it shows: Battletoads DC is based on an enhanced OpenBoR engine and uses many new and rarely used features.

More facts:
- Four playable characters: Rash, Pimple & Zitz plus Sketch Turner from Comix Zone
- Five entirely different game modes: T.Bird Rescue, Revenge & Rematch plus Zombie Party & Comix Zone.
- Loads of unique moves and stages - plus weapons!

>>I hope this will inspire someone to start his own mod or make his mod better. Have fun with it.<< - bWWd

Big thanks to Samurai X for updating the Dreamcast port of OpenBoR.
