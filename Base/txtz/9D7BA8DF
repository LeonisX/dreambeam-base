The first chapter of Yu Suzuki's epic saga is at hand. Shenmue is an adventure game that transports you to Japan, circa 1986. You are Ryo, a young man trying to solve the mystery of his father's death. Along the way, you'll be treated to the most richly-detailed game world ever conceived. Shenmue offers a true living world, where characters exist on their own timelines and almost all objects can be manipulated and used. Over the course of the adventure, you will learn new hand-to-hand fighting techniques, presented in breathtaking motion-captured animations. You'll also interact with literally hundreds of characters and solve a myriad of puzzles. It's epic storytelling at its best, and it's only on Dreamcast.
