Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
AN ELECTRIFYING RACE. 
There's no track here -- no flags, no spectators. Re-Volt takes the
racing genre and turns it upside-down by having you race at breakneck 
speed through crazy places such as a supermarket, museum, garden,
cruise ship, neighborhood, the Wild Wild West, and Toy World. These
7 fun and wacky interactive environments are chock-full of eye candy. 
Each of the 28 Re-Volt racers has a unique personality and a mind for 
destruction. Two of the cars are brand new and 12 were made
specifically for Sega Dreamcast. New gameplay and feature 
improvements are based on consumer feedback from the award winning 
PC version. There are tons of pick-ups, weapons, and surprises in
this reward-as-you-go game. Track Editor lets you create and save
your own tracks, and the graphics deliver the racing experience in 
128-bit glory.
