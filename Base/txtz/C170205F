Rip notes: Nothing Ripped

Updates of classic games rarely work. I spent a good portion of my youth on Centipede for the Atari 2600. After playing the "improved" Playstation version, I really miss my old 1-button joystick. Same goes for the root-canal-on-a-CD that is Rampage World Tour. You'd think that I would learn my lesson and stop letting cheap remakes try to ruin my love for the original game.

But then, you'd be forgetting Metal Gear Solid. Excitebike 64. Zelda 64. Sonic Adventure. Castlevania: Resurrection. Phantasy Star Online. Shinobi 3D. Virtua Fighter 4. (Okay, so now I'm just wishful thinking. But can't a man dream?)

Based on this mixed bag of good and bad updates, I was nervous about reviewing Gauntlet Legends. I shelled out enough quarters on the original Gauntlet to pay for the Aladdin's Castle owner's Corvette. I could only hope that Midway managed to include even half the fun of the original.
