It's here, Virtua Striker 2 v.2000.1 has come to Dreamcast in all its arcade perfect glory. Play any of the new modes, including Ranking and League or just sit back and enjoy the original arcade mode in the comfort of your armchair. You can save the best goal on your VMU and use it when you're competing in two-player mode. Football has never looked so good and felt so right... you can almost taste the pie and Bovril at half time.
In Tournament mode, users choose either 4, 8 or 16 teams to be entered into the tournament. League mode is available for up to 32 players and standings are kept based on a team's win/loss/draw record.
 Virtua Striker 2 supports the VGA Box, and because no analog controls are needed,
the Arcade Stick.
