Nothing.

Dead or Alive 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to one of the best 3d fighting games ever. DOA2 offers crazy combos, awesome characters, and fluid animation that must be seen to be believed. This immaculately conceived fighting game will leave players breathless and begging for more. 9 arenas, each interactive and fully 3D rendered; 12 fighters, including some truly lovely ladies; cinematic cut-scenes between each fight sequence that require no load time, all of this is delivered at an eye-scorching 60 frames per-second. The audio effects are perfectly timed,
and the soundtrack is second to none. Throw in four modes of play and a scalable difficulty setting on top of that, and you're looking at a game that is as near to godliness as you can get without actually being a god.
