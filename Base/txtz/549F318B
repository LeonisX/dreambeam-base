Game.....: Draconus: Cult of The Wyrm
Origin...: USA - NTSC
Released.: February 6th, 2001
Ripped.......: Nothing

Here's an older game which noone was ever able to rip, though many tried. It was originally 1 GD, and today we bring you our rip split onto 2 CD's. This rip works like Grandia II, you must save your game at a certain point, power off the system, switch CD's, and load up your save game.

There are quite a few ways to play this game and swap CD's since the game is somewhat non-linear.

Here are some of the routes you can take:

1. Trollsbog Cemetary -> Mago's Tower -> Falfar City -> Queen's Hive
2. Mago's Tower -> Trollsbog Cemetary -> Falfar City -> Queen's Hive
3. Trollsbog cemetary -> Falfar City -> Mago's Tower -> Queen's Hive
4. Mago's Tower -> Falfar City -> Trollsbog Cemetary -> Queen's Hive

As you can see, all of these lead up to Queen's Hive. After you finish every level, you are given the ability to save. Before entering Queen's Hive, you must save your game, power off your Dreamcast, swap CD's and load up your save game. Queen's Hive and everything after it is on the 2nd CD.

Embark on an epic quest to unite the shattered kingdoms of humanity. Bring knowledge of the arcane arts and mastery of deadly swordplay to bear the evil that threatens these last bastions of civilization. The vile Dragon Lord has come and only your cold steel and quick wits can put a stop to the horror, but be warned the Dragon Lord 
has not come alone. The stars aligned and you were born, the descendant of a once mighty king. You are the fabled "Dragonsbane," bringing your knowledge of the arcane arts and mastery of deadly swordplay against the evil that threatens civilizations.
