Power Stone kicks off Capcom's lineup on the Sega DC with the most breathtaking graphics ever seen in a fighting game. Fully interactive 3D worlds allow players to interact with the environment like never before. Collect power stones and transform your character into a raging, super natural version of himself. Battle like never before: hang from the ceiling, climb on the roof, and use benches, barrels, light poles and other items. Use a huge arsenal of weapon like bazookas, flame- throwers, swords, time bombs, Molotov cocktails and more.
Plus, collect three power stones and your character transforms into a raging super being, executing deadly power fusion moves.
Beating the game under a variety of conditions will also unlock additional features. Enjoy!
