Strap on your chainsaw, pop open your Necronomicon and come get some, baby! Ash, the square-jawed, insult-spewin shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed hero from the cult classic Evil Dead trilogy is back! Picking up eight years after the last installment of the Evil Dead films, Ash is drawn back to the infamous cabin in the woods only to again face evil forces that have crossed over to our world. Our hero finds himself slicing and dicing carnivorous Kandarian demons, vicious deadites and other unspeakable atrocities spawned by the notorious Book of the Dead. And in true Evil Dead fashion, Ash must once again attempt to save the world from an appalling and horrific end. Evil Dead: Hail to the King takes the survival horror genre to new heights by combining the successful formula of suspense, action
and puzzle. Hail to the king, baby!
