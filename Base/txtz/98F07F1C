Players tune their bikes up until they are at peak performance level, then risk it all by entering a challenge race against another player. The winner takes home both bikes, while the loser ends up sobbing in an empty garage. Ducati World Racing Challenge also lets players purchase their bikes from either a Classic Showroom featuring Ducati bikes from the 50s to today, or from the Ducati Showroom (offering modern bikes), or from the Used
Showroom, where bikers on a budget can still lay claim to an affordable Ducati.
* Over 20 different types of racing set on 8 unique tracks.
* Upgrade and tune your favorite Ducati, then take it to the track and compete in League, Classic, or Challenge races.
