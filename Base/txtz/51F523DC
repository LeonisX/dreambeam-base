~~~~~~~~~~
Take control of Gatz, a warrior of immense power, in an all out bloodbath! A disease has broken out in your small town turning afflicted citizens into Mandoragora, horribly misshapen creatures who are out for human blood.

- Play Guts, a merc with a sword the size of his lust for blood, who's out to rid the world of pesky villains and cure the land of an evil plague.
- Heavy combo system will let you go to work on evil beasties with some severe carving creativity! 
- Use multiple weapons such as your huge Berserk sword, bombs, knives, sharp sticks and if you'd like you can just duke it out hand to hand! 
- More than 30 grotesque enemies, each with a unique and fearsome attack.
