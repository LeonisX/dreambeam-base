The fifth in the Tomb Raider series by Eidos, Tomb Raider: Chronicles sees you as Lara Croft, again in a third person perspective, acquiring four unusual artefacts in four different settings. Lara Croft's friends have gathered at her memorial service and are reminiscing about her past adventures. You can go back in time and recreate four of the best ones. Lara will search for items and solve puzzles in Rome, an abandoned Russian submarine base, a haunted house, and a high-tech office building. Now you can revive the past and help Lara's memory live forever. Features two new outfits including camouflage gear and a cat suit complete with matching headset. Lara is also given some new moves (tightropes, suspended bars) and commands with corresponding animations, and can also engage in sneaky hand-to-hand combat.
