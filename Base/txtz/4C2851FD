Also a note to the people of the so called 'legitimate press':

Please take a moment and look at yourselves before you go on your
writing campaigns against piracy. I am 100% absolutely positive that
you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you
folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene
doesn't deny its roots.
