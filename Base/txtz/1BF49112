It is aloooong time you didn't hear about us, and here is the proof we're not dead :)
It was a pain to get this unreleased game.
You all know this is Mario-Kart like game that was never released by Swing since 
SEGA has announced the end of the Dreamcast.
This is not a demo but the full game and it is multi-language
So our French, english, german, spanish, and italian speakers will be happy !!
Take the role a favorite Flintstones character to race for victory in this game based
on the 2000 feature film of the same name. Contests of speed and control take place 
across a variety of dynamically lit 3D environments. Offering the most 
important go-kart racer features, several different power-ups are scattered throughout
 the levels and up to four players can compete at once.
The game is selfboot and can be played on every Dreamcast System (US,JP,Pal)
