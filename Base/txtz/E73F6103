Release Notes:
Before we even start on about this release, We have to show our undivided respect for the folks at Utopia, What you did is truly impressive! Our second note would be to those lamers sitting on their asses and begging / requesting / expecting that more DC games be released. You really have no right to do this, If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourselves? Have respect for the groups that actually contribute to the scene, such as Utopia, Paradox, Static, Accession, and the 100's of others. Do not expect us or anyone else to release all of the games you want within the next half hour. We will do whatever the hell we please and you have to live with it! If you
don't know how to use this release by now, you have no business using it. 

Game Info:
~~~~~~~~~~
Just before the arrival of the 8th Imperial Army, the player takes control of Mag and Linear and they fight their first battle, then search through their first dungeon. You'll meet and fight giant rats, giant caterpillars, and much more.

This game will fit on a normal 74 Minute / 650MB CD. Have fun with our first DC release, and DON'T look for more soon, Just be happy if you get it.
