This is a DreamSNES compilation which includes 501 PAL games. Why only PAL games? Because they run smoother and faster. *A LOT* of the included games are emulated at full speed, some run slightly slower, but are still very playable. Only very few of these games (e.g. Doom) don't run at a playable speed.
