Release Notes
You are John Mullins. You're the world's deadliest soldier of fortune and your mission is clear: survive. Track down and take out a fanatical terrorist organization bent on the mass murder and  destruction in intense and explosive missions. With an arsenal of  powerful and deadly real-world weapons at your disposal, engage in  sabotage, stealthy assassination, and full frontal assaults where only skill marks the difference between the hunter and the hunted. 
 
Game Features:
- Ultra-realistic action! Shoot someone in the leg and he falls down, writhing; shoot someone in the head and he falls down...dead. 26 different hit locations on each enemy for pinpoint accuracy and realism!
- Includes 10 deadly international missions: 'operate' on a speeding African freight train, Iraqi oil refinery, Russian chemical plant, and other political hotspots spanning 5 continents.
- Rip your way past enemy lines utilizing the world's most lethal weaponry, including sniper rifles, white phosphorous grenades, and prototype microwave pulse gun.
- Living 3-D environments. Infiltrate foreign locations as civilians and terrorists go about their lives as if you weren't there, until you blow your cover.
- Optimized Quake II engine for unprecedented enemy detail and realistic weapons damage. 

Rip Notes:
This game was huge. And hard. And not so fun to do. We worked on it for the last few days and now we present you this nice rip split  over 2 CDs. The music was converted to Mono, but all of it remains.
The company logo movies were ripped. This game now fits very hightly  onto 2 80 Minute CDs. Here is a layout of the CDs and which levels they contain:

CD1:
 - In Game Tutorial
Mission 1: Rescue and Protect
 - Level 1: The Subway
Mission 2: Nuke Retrieval
 - Level 2: Ugandan Train
 - Level 3: The Armory

Once the Armory Briefing #2 is loaded, the game will auto-save your  progress. At this point, you should turn off your Dreamcast and  swap to CD2. Armory Briefing #2 is contained on both CD1 & CD2,  so this is the swap point. After you have swapped, you can play the rest of the game all the way to the end.
