Based on the PC game Speed Busters, Ubi-Soft's Speed Devils delivers the kind of arcade racing game experience you've been waiting for. 
 
Starting in the lower classes, race your way to victory by wining cash and buying upgrades/repairs or faster racing machines to beat the A-Class champion, Racer X.
 Extra cash is earned by completing side tasks set by your sponsor or placing bets with the other racers.
 
Visible car damage, weather effects and track specific pit falls (T-Rex & King Kong in Hollywood??) are just some of the graphical effects that await you. Superb track design with 12 tracks, each with variations will keep you coming back for more and the 2 player option, with various modes including defend & attack, distance lag, time lag, and special challenge will keep you and your friends happy. 
 
 Hit the nitro and leave the competition eating your exhaust fumes...............
