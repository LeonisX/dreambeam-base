Finally, 
though noone really expected it, we made your dreams come true:
Dreamcast BootCD V1.1 - boot copies and imports on a NON-chipped (!) standard consumer model.

Usage:
- switch off, insert BootCD into Dreamcast and switch on again 
- Wait until the Utopia introscreen comes up, then open door and insert either Import-GD or copied CD. Close door again. 
- Wait until spinning disc comes up; game will be loaded automatically

Important:
- do ONLY (!) use DiscJuggler to burn this image (standard blank) 
- do ONLY (!) use DiscJuggler to copy this CD

Sorry for any inconviniences, but standard CDRWIN is not really capable neither creating nor imaging the CD.

Don't get on our nerves asking for copies, we will release a couple of games during the next weeks, so just stay tuned for some more releases from your favourite console group :)

Copies so far available:
- Dead or Alive II(about to be released within the next few hours) 
- Soul Calibur 
- F1 GP
- Resident Evil Code Veronica
