This game was the followup to the commercial success WWF Warzone. At the time it was the wrestling game to have featured the most modes. The 20 or so game modes included specialty matches like royal rumble, survior series, tornado matches and more. Also featured was a new career mode compared to that of WWF Warzone, realistic entrances and a first ever Create a PPV mode. The game featured over 40 of the then current WWF Superstars, including hidden ones. The Create A Wrestler feature was one of the most advanced of its time.
