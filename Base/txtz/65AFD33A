A single player 3D fantasy fighting game, Soul fighter is reminiscent of such arcade hits as Golden Axe, Double Dragon, and Final Fight. Players will encounter 40 different enemies and level bosses, each with over 44 motion-captured animation sequences for running, fighting and dying. Enemy characters will stalk you, attack in groups and even call in reinforcements to keep you from your objective. Soul Fighter's stunning graphics and animations run at a retina-scorching 60 frames per second, keeping the action immersive and fast-paced. This graphic detail extends to include real-time shadows for characters and background elements, real dynamic fog, rainfall, lightning and a variety of realistic animated backgrounds such as waterfalls, seascapes and wind-blown flags. Fight using your hands, legs or weapons such as knives, axes, crossbows, & bombs!
