Nothing.

Are you ready to tear up some track? Traveling at dizzying speeds, you'll make your way around course after course, recklessly smashing into just about everything. The game's 15 tracks will have you racing through cities, the countryside, abandoned warehouses, and more. Choose from a list of more than 20 licensed and fantasy cars,
and then get set to speed past the competition in your strides toward glory. Quick Race mode lets you jump right
into the action as soon as you flip your Dreamcast on; Championship is an all-inclusive series that will have your
endurance stretched to its limits, while Time Trial allows you to test your mettle against a series of opponents.
The car models and drivers are highly detailed, making for a very realistic gaming experience, and the physics are
more simulation than arcade-style. A perfect party game, it allows four players to race simultaneously.
