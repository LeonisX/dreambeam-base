that you'll gather along the way.  You must also survive grueling battles and demanding quests that test your heroic stamina. As the journey progresses, you'll be joined by five other adventurers, each with specialized talents that can help you 
restore order to a warped Universe. 
* 6 main characters to choose from. Over 30 characters to interact with.
* Monster missions and sub games for the VMU add to the fun.
